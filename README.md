# cs-246--module-networking

# Program Description: 

The purpose of creating this program is to gain familiarity with the following\
requirements:

- Write a program that allows one computer to communicate with another computer using either of the following:

- Client-Server Model—You will need to write one program for the client and one program for the server.

- Peer-to-Peer Model—You will need to write one program for the peer to both send and receive.

- The software should implement either a collaboration system, problem solving system, file delivery system, or embedded system. Examples of each of these systems are shown in the Overview section above. The software may be written in any programming language.

- Only one kind of request needs to be sent between computers, with the appropriate response.

- The program can run from the command line (no graphics needed).

- You can use either TCP or UDP.



# Stretch goal for this project (limit of one): 

- Provide support for at least three different kinds of requests that the server or the peer can respond to.

- Provide configuration files that are read at software initialization to define IP addresses, ports, etc.

- Provide a graphical user interface (GUI) for your program instead of the command line.
